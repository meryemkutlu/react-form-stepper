# Features

It is form stepper application.

# Built With
- **React + Vite:** This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
- **Tailwind:** Tailwind CSS is an open source CSS framework. The main feature of this library is that, unlike other CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, it does not provide a set of predefined classes for elements such as buttons or tables.
- **Formik & Yup:** Formik is a library that simplifies form management in React applications, while Yup is used for JavaScript object schema validation. Formik tracks form state, validates values, submits, and handles form processing, whereas Yup checks if form inputs conform to specific rules. When used together, they streamline form operations, making them easier and more reliable.
